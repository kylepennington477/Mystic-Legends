  <h1>Mystic Legends - Code of Honor</h1>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Community First. Fun Always.</h2>
    <p>Our number one rule is simple: <strong>Have fun</strong>. We’re building a community grounded in respect, fair play, and camaraderie. Whether you're here to climb the ranks or just enjoy a great game -- you're part of something legendary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Player Identity Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Any player name that may be considered inappropriate or offensive will be temporarily <strong>shielded</strong>. If your ID is boxed, please contact an Admin for assistance in updating your name.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Respectful Conduct</h2>
    <p>Profanity, fighting, and accusations are not tolerated. Disagreements should be handled calmly through proper channels. Honor your fellow legends.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Behavior Enforcement</h2>
    <p>Players who use profanity, engage in threatening behavior, or create a hostile environment will be <strong>shielded</strong> and removed if the behavior continues.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Match Commitment</h2>
    <p>Leaving games or intentionally disqualifying repeatedly will result in penalties. Legends see battles through.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Zero Tolerance for Cheating</h2>
    <p>Cheating of any kind will result in immediate disciplinary action. Victory must be earned with honor.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Resign Button Policy</h2>
    <p>Do not use the <strong>Resign</strong> button unless absolutely necessary. Legends don’t back down from a challenge.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>One Account Per Player</h2>
    <p>Players are allowed one account only. Multiple accounts will lead to removal or restriction.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Slow Play Policy</h2>
    <p>Each round is capped at <strong>45 minutes</strong>. Deliberate delays are not tolerated.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Table Creation Responsibility</h2>
    <p>The first player listed must create the table. If not done within 2 minutes, the second player is expected to set it up.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>MIA Timer</h2>
    <p>If a player is inactive for more than <strong>5 minutes</strong>, they may forfeit the match. Timeliness matters.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Multi-Game Limit</h2>
    <p>Players may enter up to 3 games at a time. If this results in slow play, you will be asked to DQ and limited to one game moving forward.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>No Spectating or Kibitzing</h2>
    <p>Watching games you are not actively playing in is not permitted. Keep the arena fair and focused.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>SHG Messenger Requirement</h2>
    <p>Players must appear <strong>Online</strong> on SHG Messenger while in the lobby. Those on <strong>DND</strong> will not be allowed to participate in games or tournaments.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>ID Consistency</h2>
    <p>Your Safe Harbor Games ID and Mystic Legends ID must be identical. Inconsistencies may restrict your participation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule">
    <h2>Reporting Matches</h2>
    <p>Both players must report the <strong>win and the loss</strong> in the lobby after each game. Transparency is key.</p>
